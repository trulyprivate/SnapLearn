## TDD Implementation Roadmap

The SnapLearn iOS integration will follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology, with incremental features and accompanying tests. This approach ensures quality, maintainability, and helps identify issues early in the development cycle.

### TDD Process Overview

For each feature increment:
1. **Write tests first** - Create tests that define the expected behavior
2. **Run tests to verify they fail** - Confirm tests detect missing functionality
3. **Implement minimal code** - Write code to make tests pass
4. **Verify tests pass** - Run tests to confirm implementation works
5. **Refactor code** - Improve code quality while keeping tests green
6. **Repeat** - Move to the next feature increment

## Implementation Challenges and Mitigations

### Challenge 1: Camera Integration Complexity
**Risk**: iOS and Android have significantly different camera APIs, making shared code difficult.
**Mitigation**: Create a narrow, well-defined interface for the camera functionality, focusing on sharing the post-processing logic rather than camera control code.

### Challenge 2: AI Model Integration
**Risk**: Gemini Pro integration might have platform-specific requirements.
**Mitigation**: Implement a common API client in the shared module with platform-specific optimizations if needed. Monitor performance to identify any platform differences.

### Challenge 3: Kotlin Flow on iOS
**Risk**: Kotlin Flows aren't natively supported in Swift.
**Mitigation**: Implement either KMP-NativeCoroutines or SKIE to bridge Flow to Swift Combine or async/await. Create thorough tests to verify behavior consistency.

### Challenge 4: Native Look and Feel
**Risk**: Using shared code might compromise platform-native look and feel.
**Mitigation**: Limit shared code to non-UI components. Implement separate UI layers using SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose respectively.

### Challenge 5: Dependency Management
**Risk**: Managing dependencies across platforms adds complexity.
**Mitigation**: Use version catalogs to centralize dependency versions. Carefully evaluate libraries for multiplatform support.
